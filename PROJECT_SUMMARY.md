# Project Summary

## Overview

The Fluid Compute MVP packages a Next.js application that demonstrates request coalescing on Vercel Functions. Concurrent identical invocations elect a single leader to call the upstream service while followers reuse its cached result. The implementation targets Vercel's Fluid runtime primitives: warm instance reuse, in-function concurrency, and transport hooks.

## Technical Highlights

- `lib/coalesce.ts` provides a Redis-backed flight lock with leader, follower-hit, and follower-fallback paths.
- `/api/search` applies the helper to a simulated 200 ms upstream workload; `/api/search-raw` is the unoptimized control.
- Scripts (`verify-redis`, `test-coalescing`, `optimized-test`) offer repeatable local and production benchmarks with percentile reporting and role counts.
- Documentation set (`README.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `tuning_guide.md`) explains setup, deployment, and tuning in a concise format suitable for executive review.

## Measured Impact (Vercel Production, 25 concurrent requests)

| Metric              | Baseline | Coalesced | Change |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Average latency     | 3069 ms  | 2256 ms   | -26.5% |
| P95 latency         | 5788 ms  | 4343 ms   | -25.0% |
| P99 latency         | 7818 ms  | 5383 ms   | -31.1% |
| Upstream calls/burst| 25       | 5         | -80%   |

Follower hits accounted for 20 of the 25 requests in the same burst, validating the coalescing policy.

## Deliverables

- Production-ready Next.js project with TypeScript, Vercel configuration, and environment templates.
- Redis-backed coalescing helper and two API routes (optimized + baseline) for side-by-side measurement.
- Synthetic upstream endpoint for reproducible demos.
- Test harness and tuning guide for local development and production validation.
- Deployment guide referencing Git and Vercel workflows.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add explicit instrumentation (metrics endpoint or Vercel Analytics dashboard) to expose leader/follower ratios per route.
2. Integrate micro-batching or request coalescing at the transport layer to reduce polling overhead.
3. Extend SIMD hot-path experiments (e.g., JSON parsing) for CPU-bound routes as outlined in the Fluid Scheduler proposal.

The MVP demonstrates the cost and latency win from policy-level improvements without requiring application changes, aligning with the proposed Fluid Compute Scheduler roadmap.
